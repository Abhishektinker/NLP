created for this type of work is an adaptable system in VM? .ova / .iso ?\\n05:12 < sTrikEforCe> what do you mean? you want a binary you can send out and a c&c server / web panel?\\n05:12 < lazarus> we must learn\\n05:12 <&Iggy> For the way you express your question I doubt you could make it to build a botnet and if by any chance you do, I hardly believe you would know what to do with one\\n05:13 <&Iggy> He wants to build one. The C&C is required by any botnet\\n05:13 <&Iggy> Control panels are optional\\n05:14 < sTrikEforCe> Iggy: I make my living reversing malware and studying c&c servers and web components. I know that the web component is part of the c&c server. I also research the crypters. \\n05:15 <&Iggy> Good for you.\\n05:15 < sTrikEforCe> but someone who comes on here to ask that, wouldn\\'t have any ability to build a botnet at all.\\n05:15 <&Iggy> lazarus, get the zeuz pack in a black market. Thats like the easiest way for you to get started\\n05:15 <&Iggy> Someone even created a fucking how-to list I think\\n05:16 < lazarus> very well when creating my profile zombie IP 150 are ready about now that I have them in my system armitage I want to connect them together\\n05:16 < sTrikEforCe> what the fuck does that mean?\\n05:16 <&Iggy> No idea\\n05:17 <&Iggy> The way most of botnets work is: Infected systems connect to C&C (Command & Control) and from the C&C you can order them to do shit\\n05:18 < sTrikEforCe> for sure. but the least detected was is over http or https\\n05:18 < sTrikEforCe> but most botnet owners can\\'t get the cert for https\\n05:18 < sTrikEforCe> so it goes over port 80\\n05:19 <&Iggy> What do you want the botnet for?\\n05:19 < sTrikEforCe> originally it went over irc [6667] but av would flag it\\n05:19 <&Iggy> If just for DDoS then I recommend an IRC botnet. Easier to compile, no need to infect so much shit and easy to handle\\n05:20 < sTrikEforCe> absolutely\\n05:20 <&Iggy> If you want to steal HTTP/s traffic (which I doubt) then do build a malware that connects to a C&C and infect in whichever way you find more appropiate\\n05:21 < sTrikEforCe> lazarus: if it\\'s about DDOS you would be better off paying a service via bitcoin and not worring about the managment and getting bots.\\n05:21 <&Iggy> Mostly used nowadays is cookie poisoning and browser hijacking\\n05:21 < sTrikEforCe> Iggy: I think we are trying to help someone who doesn\\'t even understand at all WTF we are talking about.\\n05:22 <&Iggy> Thats the idea, he still can Google all that\\n05:23 < sTrikEforCe> Iggy: the problem is. he should have googled it first. then if he didn\\'t understand it; as for clarification.\\n05:23 <&Iggy> Yeah\\n05:23 < lazarus> sTrikEforCe: lazarus: if it\\'s about DDOS you would be better off paying a service via bitcoin and not worring about the managment and getting bots.

itsomrfi_k> and running the listener off that\\n12:05 < itsomrfi_k> why?\\n12:05 < catface_> get on shodan and look for openvpn servers that are heartbleed vulnerable\\n12:05 < catface_> you\\'ll find plaintext usernames and passwords in the headers\\n12:06 < itsomrfi_k> I don\\'t know how openvpn servers work :/\\n12:06 < itsomrfi_k> Is it like your normal ftp web server or?\\n12:06 < catface_> theyre a piece of piss, you get the username and password then login and grab the client.ovpn file\\n12:07 < catface_> if youre on linux just open a terminal and type \"openvpn client.ovpn\" and type in the username and password where prompted\\n12:07 < itsomrfi_k> so that gives me access to a linux based machine or a VPN?\\n12:07 < catface_> lots wont use ip forwarding so you\\'ll have to set that up on your side by forwarding all your eth0 or wlan0 traffic to tun0\\n12:07 < itsomrfi_k> im sorry for being such a noob\\n12:07 < catface_> but some have it setup already\\n12:07 < catface_> youll still be on your machine its just all your traffic will be routed through that vpn\\n12:08 < itsomrfi_k> hmm\\n12:08 < catface_> if you want on \"whats my ip\" on google instead of your ip which would be 72.100.100.100 or whatever it would have the VPNs IP of 69.69.69.69 or whatever\\n12:08 < itsomrfi_k> so basically, I will just need to connect to that server whenever I want to use metasploit listener?\\n12:09 < catface_> it might take some configuring if it already isnt, it depends how its been setup\\n12:09 < itsomrfi_k> Okay, but what if the server gets shut down or something, I will no longer have access to the shell...\\n12:09 < catface_> and youve gotta be careful whos vpn it is youre stealing\\n12:10 < catface_> ive bumped into some big ones owned by massive companies who wouldnt take lightly to intruders on their intranet\\n12:10 < catface_> especially when you see whats on their network\\n12:11 < catface_> yeah if the server gets shut down then your routing tables will reset to what theyre at now\\n12:11 < catface_> its not a big deal, you just find another\\n12:11 < catface_> you can chain them together too, so you can get a bunch of them and you\\'ll have devices like \"tunnel1 tunnel2 tunnel3\" \\n12:11 < catface_> you can setup your ip tables to route tunnel1 to tunnel2 and tunnel2 to tunnel3 \\n12:11 -!- Mavis [eleven@bea.con] has quit [Client exited]\\n12:12 < itsomrfi_k> Agh, I\\'ve got no knowledge of iptables or openvpn servers, I just skip that part and metasploit works fine, I\\'ll look it up \\n12:13 < catface_> what is it youre exploiting at the moment ?\\n12:13 < catface_> like what i mean is, is it really important that you try hide what youre doing ?\\n12:14 < catface_> see if you want to practice you can setup vulnerable services on your home network and fuck around with those and then maybe rent some web hosting space and setup vulnerable services on that and fuck around with it\\n12:15 < catface_> in which case it doesnt really matter if youre trying to obfuscate your location or not\\n12:15 < itsomrfi_k> Oh, so the openvpn thing you were talking about was going to make me anonymouse.\\n12:15 < itsomrfi_k> I thought it was going to run my listener on it\\n12:16 < itsomrfi_k> actually I wanted to rent a VPS so that when I\\'m not using linux/ im working on photoshop, the listener is still going to be listening for connections, that way i dont have to keep metasploit open on my machine all the time\\n12:16 < itsomrfi_k> or does the listener work even if the machine is off and when it turns on a session is there in metasploit?\\n12:17 < catface_> you can run it silent or run it on a VM or run it on another box or whatever\\n12:17 < catface_> have you used a netcat handler before ?\\n12:18 -!- kernelpanic [kernelpanic@puking.in.the.parking.lot.like.a.skid] has joined #hackers\\n12:19 < itsomrfi_k> never, heard about it before though, is it like telnet?\\n12:19 < catface_> give it a quick google, it wont take long to figure out, its just a really basic tool for networking\\n12:20 < catface_> try google \"setting up a netcat basic handler\"\\n12:20 < catface_> you can start a server on 1 box using netcat and then connect to it from another box, you can do all this just from a simple 1 liner\\n12:20 < catface_> itll give you an idea how metasploit is working\\n12:21 < itsomrfi_k> thanks\\n12:21 < itsomrfi_k> so if my target opens the file when metasploit is not running on my machine, will i have a session the next time i open msf? \\n12:22 < catface_> no\\n12:22 < catface_> have you got wireshark ?\\n12:23 < catface_> itd be worth reading up about how computers communicate\\n12:23 < catface_> it -might- connect if its constantly trying to look for your machine\\n12:23 < itsomrfi_k> ah\\n12:23 < catface_> for example on your lan there are packets constantly being thrown around\\n12:23 < itsomrfi_k> so the connect command is only run when he opens the file\\n12:24 < catface_> computers asking \"who is x\"\\n12:24 < catface_> and theyll be asking that constantly until someone replies\\n12:24 < catface_> your wifi adapter is constantly sending out probes\\n12:24 < catface_> so say your home wifi is called \"bobs wifi\"\\n12:24 < itsomrfi_k> ok\\n12:24 < catface_> if you have bobs wifi saved on your computer and its set to auto connect to bobs wifi\\n12:25 < catface_> your wifi adapter is going \"are you bobs wifi\"\\n12:25 < catface_> and its doing that constantly until your AP goes \"im bobs wifi\"\\n12:25 < catface_> whats interesting is you can setup an access point to say \"yes im $ wifi\"\\n12:25 < catface_> so itll answer yes to every probe\\n12:25 < catface_> meaning if people are walking around with devices wanting to auto connect theyll connect to your AP regardless of if its the legit AP or not\\n12:26 < catface_> so you can see how that would be a security issue\\n12:26 < catface_> you\\'d have to get wireshark open and have a look at if that meterpreter session or whatever if is your running is constantly sending \"is x there\" packets or if it just sends it once\\n12:27 < itsomrfi_k> oh\\n12:27 < itsomrfi_k> so by default msf doesnt do that\\n12:27 < itsomrfi_k> it only sends the connect packet once?\\n12:27 < catface_> i dunno lol youd have to look with wireshark\\n12:27 < itsomrfi_k> oh ok \\n12:27 < catface_> ive never really tested it like that ive always had the handler open and waiting for the incoming connection\\n12:28 < catface_> with something like a botnet you\\'d want the incoming connection constantly sending those packets\\n12:28 < catface_> so if your handler goes down you can boot it back up and your botnet will come back online straight away\\n12:30 -!- riad-BSC

sh4d0wth13f> Should he host on a designated linux server, goru?  seems more fun\\n06:10 < Justbob> oh it is? got it .. well I\\'m not really tied to mac anymore.. i tried to back from linux just for

he\\'s tryna host a website\\n06:12 < Justbob> and i already have linux as my main OSs\\n06:12 < Justbob> if i was serious about hosting id probably go with linux though, i know the terminal way better than I do on a mac \\n06:13 < Goru> mac is POSIX\\n06:13 < Goru> so it\\'s kinda the same\\n06:13 < Goru> i think mac has bash actually\\n06:14 < Justbob> it does? i tried the same kind of

this attack dont work\\n12:54 < t4ise> In fute\\n12:54 < t4ise> Future\\n12:55 < catface> oh yeah i see, well not really, its main issue is it wont work on a locked machine\\n12:55 < catface> theres
